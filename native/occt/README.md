# InvariantCAD OCCT facade

This directory owns the reproducible boundary between InvariantCAD and the
native OCCT WebAssembly facade. The exact upstream source, OCCT gitlink,
compiler toolchains, and builder image are immutable inputs recorded in
[`upstream.lock.json`](./upstream.lock.json). Builds never use an unpinned
`latest` image.

## Build

The normal build needs Git, Python 3, GNU `patch`, `tar`, `sha256sum`, and a
rootless Podman installation:

```sh
./scripts/build-occt-facade.sh
```

The script performs four bounded phases:

1. Fetch and verify the exact `occt-wasm` tag and commit (or verify an existing
   checkout passed with `--source-dir`). It also verifies that the source's
   OCCT gitlink is the locked OCCT commit.
2. Export the verified commit into a temporary staging directory and apply
   every `native/occt/patches/*.patch` file in bytewise filename order.
3. Hydrate a fresh Cargo cache in a narrowly networked container, then compile
   in a separate container with `--network=none`, all capabilities dropped,
   and `no-new-privileges`. Both containers use the builder image by digest.
4. Copy only `occt-wasm.js` and `occt-wasm.wasm` into
   `.artifacts/occt-facade/`, alongside `SHA256SUMS` for those two files.

Neither the repository root nor the user's home directory is mounted into a
container. The container sees only an exported temporary source tree and a
dedicated Cargo cache. The prebuilt OCCT libraries come from the immutable
builder image; the actual compilation and link phase has no network route.

For repeated builds, use a dedicated, credential-free Cargo cache:

```sh
mkdir -p .cache/occt-facade-cargo
./scripts/build-occt-facade.sh \
  --source-dir /path/to/occt-wasm-v3.7.0 \
  --cargo-cache-dir .cache/occt-facade-cargo

./scripts/build-occt-facade.sh \
  --source-dir /path/to/occt-wasm-v3.7.0 \
  --cargo-cache-dir .cache/occt-facade-cargo \
  --skip-fetch
```

`--skip-fetch` makes the complete invocation offline. It therefore requires an
already-present pinned Podman image, an exact existing source checkout, and a
previously hydrated Cargo cache. The script rejects Cargo credential files in
the mounted cache.

Patches belong in `native/occt/patches/` and should use Git's `a/` and `b/`
path prefixes. Prefix filenames with an ordering number (for example,
`0001-draft-history.patch`) because lexical order is part of the build.

## License, source, and replacement boundary

`occt-wasm` facade code is upstream open-source code, while Open CASCADE
Technology is licensed under GNU LGPL 2.1 with the Open CASCADE exception. The
exception covers material incorporated from OCCT header files; it should not
be treated as a blanket waiver of LGPL obligations. This document is an
engineering boundary, not legal advice.

The generated `.wasm` statically contains OCCT. It is not, by itself, a
dynamically replaceable OCCT library. Any distribution of that binary must be
accompanied by a reviewed compliance bundle that, at minimum:

- carries the applicable OCCT, facade, and third-party notices and license
  texts;
- makes the complete corresponding OCCT source at the locked commit, all local
  patches, and the exact build inputs available by a durable compliant method;
- preserves a practical way for recipients to modify OCCT and relink a
  compatible `occt-wasm.js`/`occt-wasm.wasm` pair, including any relinkable
  material required by LGPL 2.1; and
- does not add signing, integrity, or loader restrictions that prevent a user
  from substituting that rebuilt pair.

The digest-pinned builder makes facade builds reproducible, but it is not the
source offer and does not prove publisher authenticity. For an OCCT-source
replacement, check out the locked OCCT fork and commit, rebuild the builder
image from upstream's `Dockerfile.builder`, audit the result, and deliberately
update the image digest in the lock. Facade-only changes should be carried as
ordered patches here so the replacement path remains inspectable.
